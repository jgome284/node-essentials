# Node Essentials

Node.js is a popular runtime that revolutionized JavaScript development. It enabled backend development using the JavaScript that front-end developers were already familiar with. Node comes with its own variables and core modules accessible for use. This project outlines node essential tools in the [node.ipynb](./node.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.

## Development Environment
This project is set up with a .devcontainer for use on Visual Studio Code. For more information reference [developing inside a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) on VS Code.

## Get Started
If you'd like to set up a local development environment to work with this Jupyter Notebook, reference the [tutorial for devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) on VS Code.
